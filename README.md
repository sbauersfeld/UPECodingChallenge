My program works by first guessing the most frequently used letters in english.
After it first fails to guess correctly, it finds the word with the smallest number
of undiscovered characters and compares the filled in letters with a dictionary of lyrics.
All possible lyrics are grouped into one array, and this list is searched for the most
frequent letter that has not yet been choses. This letter is guessed next.

In order to run the program, simply type python3 hangman.py into your terminal.
